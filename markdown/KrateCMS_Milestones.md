     - Implement role-based access control.
   - **Outcome**: Fully functional user management with MVC structure.

## 3. Vinyl Records Module Complete
   - **Goal**: Finalize the vinyl records collection module.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Refactor the vinyl records logic into MVC (create `VinylRecord` model, `VinylController`, and views).
     - Add features for managing vinyl records, including image uploads and external links.
     - Implement the BPM counter.
   - **Outcome**: A completed module for managing and displaying vinyl records.

## 4. Integration with Postmark for Email Notifications
   - **Goal**: Fully integrate Postmark for sending email notifications.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement the `EmailManager` class for sending transactional emails.
     - Set up email notifications for critical actions (e.g., new user registration, record updates).
     - Test email notifications in different environments (development, production).
   - **Outcome**: A robust email notification system using Postmark.

## 5. Complete MVC Refactor
   - **Goal**: Refactor the entire KrateCMS codebase to follow the MVC pattern.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Complete MVC refactor for all modules (contacts, vinyl records, users).
     - Separate business logic, database access, and presentation layers.
     - Ensure all new features adhere to MVC principles.
   - **Outcome**: A fully structured and organized MVC codebase.

## 6. Implement Twig for View Rendering
   - **Goal**: Transition all view templates to use the Twig templating engine.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up Twig in the project.
     - Convert all existing PHP views to Twig templates.
     - Implement reusable components (e.g., headers, footers, forms).
   - **Outcome**: A consistent, modern templating system that makes views easier to manage and maintain.

## 7. Add Laravel Integration
   - **Goal**: Begin migrating KrateCMS to Laravel.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up Laravel environment.
     - Implement user management in Laravel as a test module.
     - Gradually migrate other features (vinyl records, email notifications, etc.).
   - **Outcome**: A hybrid KrateCMS with some modules running on Laravel.

## 8. React Integration for the Frontend
   - **Goal**: Integrate React for a modern, interactive front-end.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Create a React app for the user interface.
     - Develop React components for vinyl records, user management, etc.
     - Implement API endpoints (in PHP or Laravel) to serve data to React components.
   - **Outcome**: A partially or fully React-driven front-end for KrateCMS.

## 9. API Development
   - **Goal**: Create a REST API to interact with KrateCMS.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Define API routes for key resources (users, vinyl records).
     - Implement authentication and authorization for API users.
     - Ensure API responses follow RESTful standards (JSON).
   - **Outcome**: A public API for external services to interact with KrateCMS.

## 10. Full Deployment to Production
   - **Goal**: Deploy KrateCMS to a production environment.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Set up a production environment (on Cloudways or another platform).
     - Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
     - Ensure environment-specific settings (like Postmark API keys) are configured properly.
     - Perform security audits and optimizations.
   - **Outcome**: A live, production-ready version of KrateCMS.

## 11. Optimize and Scale
   - **Goal**: Optimize KrateCMS for performance and scalability.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., vinyl records).
     - Improve database indexing and query efficiency.
     - Add load balancing and backups for the production environment.
   - **Outcome**: A fast and scalable CMS ready for increased traffic and usage.

## 12. Multi-language and Internationalization
   - **Goal**: Add support for multiple languages.
   - **Tasks**:
     - Implement translation files using Twigâ€™s translation features.
     - Create a user interface for switching between languages.
