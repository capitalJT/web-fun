<h1>Session Summary</h1>
<p>In this session, we focused on enhancing various aspects of your PHP-based web application, specifically revolving around user authentication and management functionalities. Hereâ€™s a summary of the key tasks and improvements we made:</p>

<h2>Login Page Enhancements:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We discussed and refined the <code>login.php</code> script to include more robust security practices such as the usage of sessions and redirecting logged-in users to prevent redundant logins.</li>
    <li>We improved the security of the login mechanism by suggesting the use of prepared statements and password hashing techniques for safer user authentication.</li>
    <li>A logout button was added to the login page, allowing logged-in users a straightforward option to log out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logout Functionality:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We created a <code>logout.php</code> script that properly handles session termination. This script clears session variables and destroys the session, ensuring users are securely logged out.</li>
    <li>We updated the <code>KrateUserManager</code> class to include a <code>logout</code> method that encompasses session destruction and optionally clearing session cookies for enhanced security.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Code Cleanup and Enhancements:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We performed a cleanup of your PHP scripts (<code>login.php</code> and <code>logout.php</code>) to improve readability, maintainability, and security. This included organizing the code structure, adding comments, and ensuring consistent coding practices.</li>
    <li>We discussed the separation of concerns between business logic and presentation in your scripts to improve the architectural design of your application.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Debugging and Troubleshooting:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We addressed a "File not found" error by troubleshooting potential issues with file paths and permissions. This involved debugging the PHP include paths and ensuring the server configuration was correct.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Future Recommendations:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>We talked about best practices for further enhancing the security and user experience of your web application, such as enforcing HTTPS, using modern PHP features, and implementing error handling and session security measures.</li>
</ul>

<p>This session provided a comprehensive overview of improving user authentication flows in your application, from login to logout, with a strong emphasis on security, code quality, and user experience. You can use these enhancements as a foundation for further development and refinement of your application.</p>
