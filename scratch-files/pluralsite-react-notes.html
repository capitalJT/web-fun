            <h3>The Basics</h3>
            <p>React has a special object if you need to enclose multiple elements without introducing a new div parent. You can use React.Fragment.</p>

            <p>Responsibility isolation. Each component has certain responsibilities, and they get to focus on that.</p>

            <p>Where to define the state? Down in a tree as close as possible to the children who need access to that value on the state.</p>

            <h3>Modern JavaScript Crash Course</h3>

            <p>One of the main selling points of components is re-usability. Make a component generic enough so we can reuse it in different cases.</p>

            <p>You need a function reference for the onClick handler</p>

- References assigned with const cannot be changed.
- In most cases its preferred to use const over let because you can almost guarantee that the value hasn't changed

- A stateless functional component is a function that return a UIs

    <h3>What exactly is Lifestyle photography?</h3>
    <p>First things first! When you search lifestyle photography, here's what comes up; 'Lifestyle photography is a kind of photography that mainly aims to capture portrait/people in situations, real-life events or milestones in an artistic manner and the art of the everyday. The primary goal is to tell stories about people's lives or to inspire people in different times.' For me this means not asking your kids to say 'cheese!' and instead just loving them hard and letting the session happen. We're after authentic moments with your favorite people after all.</p>

    <h3>What can I expect at a session?</h3>
    <p>Location has been decided on, outfits have been chosen and now it's go time! Don't worry if you're feeling nervous about it, I feel nervous every time we have our family pictures taken, just ask my husband! It's natural to feel a little awkward standing in front of someone you've never met who's holding a camera. But not to worry, my goal is to make everyone feel comfortable and to forget I'm even there. I don't want you to worry about how your kids are acting or what you're supposed to do. Leave it to me to make sure your gallery is filled with genuine belly laughs, tight squeezes, tender moments and lots of fun!  I'll give you prompts so don't feel awkward, make sure you're in the most flattering light and suggest games to play with the kids so everyone’s having fun. No stiff poses or forced smiles here!</p>

    <h3>What to wear?</h3>
    <p>Something you feel fabulous in! But stick to a color palette instead of being too matchy matchy. It's always a toss up between jeans and a favorite t-shirt or an oh so pretty maxi dress for me!. Remember, l'm ways just a text or phone call away if you get stuck. And, I just happen to be an expert online shopper so will happily send you links to some of my favorite shops.</p>

    <h3>Where will the shoot take place? Inside or outside? At our home or another location? Yikes! My home isn't picture perfect!</h3>
    <p>Wherever location you choose, believe me, it will be the perfect place because you'll be with your favorite people. I have to say though, I love sessions at home, they're my absolute favorite. It's your space, where everyone feels their best and where your life happens. And don't worry, this is honest photography we're documenting your life right now in this moment, so don't stress if you're house isn't perfect. I get it! Have I told you yet that I have 3 little boys and 2 large furry dogs? A messy house and kids go hand in hand in my opinion and I assure you, that doesn't mean we won’t be able to find a perfect spot for your family to love on each other. But we can always venture outside, front steps or blankets in the backyard are also pretty amazing. Even cuddled on the sidewalk curb is fab! A favorite ice cream or coffee shop is pretty great too, we just need to figure out what type of documentary session you're after and plan from there.</p>

    <h3>When will our pictures be ready?</h3>
    <p>Your photos will be ready for you within two weeks. I'll send you a link for an online gallery where you can download your full session in 300dpi high resolution. There will also be an option to order prints if you'd like and if you intend to display them as art in your home, I highly recommend having them done by a professional lab.</p>

    <h3>Family</h3>

I do understand how important planning is though so budget a time commitment of between 1-2 hours.</p>

    <p class="mb-4">Can I let you in on a little secret? As much as I love taking pictures of kids and I LOVE taking pictures of kids, I love capturing connections between them and their parents even more. And you know why? Because someday, they're going to look at those pictures and see the love on their parents faces and remember how much fun they had together. Parents are the storytellers and memory keeps for their families lives and one parent, typically mom, is the family photographer. Your children adore you and want to see pictures of you. You need to be in pictures with your kids!! Thank you for trusting me with your memories.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I'm a mom to three amazing boys who are 5 and under and two scruffy fur babies, also boys. They are wild little balls of energy and there are lots of wrestling matches, muddy shoes, fart jokes and talk about ninjas. There are also tight squeezes and storytime snuggles. I really am the luckiest mom!</p>
    <p class="mb-4">My family and I have been living in the Bay Area for 2 years and never want to leave, we just love it here! We're Canadian and miss our family and friends fiercely but have found an incredible tribe of families to surround ourselves with so living here really feels like home.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I'm a creative person by nature but I didn't really pick up a camera until my oldest son was born. Once I was a mom though, I carried my camera everywhere. I wanted to capture and hold onto their childhood through my lens so looking back years later, I would be transported back to that moment.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">My guilty pleasures are peanut butter cups, online shopping and HGTV design shows. And I also looove spending an afternoon walking around new areas and window shopping with my husband. Bonus if we find a cafe that sells chocolate croissants and lattes.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">I live in jeans and t-shirts. I love hats and sunglasses and have a weakness for jackets and extra large tote bags. I also refuse to wear anything but sweats or yoga pants at home.</p>
    <p class="mb-4">Now it's your turn and I love to chat so email or Facebook or Instagram me!</p>
