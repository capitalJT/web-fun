# To install:  
- Clone the repo. I have this project located in my `Sites` directory.
- `cd` into the directory and run `npm install`.
- After all of the dependencies have been installed run `gulp`.
- All of the processes will run and should open a new browser tab to `localhost:3000`.
- You're good to go.
